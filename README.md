A Deck API written in Go based upon https://github.com/crobertsbmw/

The implementation that https://github.com/crobertsbmw/ gave was excellent but I needed support for Jockers
and allowing multiple decks to push to the same pile.

I know I could have requested the features from the original author. I also wanted to use this as an excercise for my Golang
journey.

This project is still a work in progress.
